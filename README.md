This folder contains projects coded in C++ while attending Luzerne County Community College for an Associate's in Computer Science.
All of the code for the data structures utilized in these programs were given to us after discussing the structures conceptually.
These programs focus on utilizing the data structures appropriately to accomplish small tasks.
