Write a program that can perform some statistical analysis. When your program runs, user will be greeted with the menu below

1. Enter a new number.
2. Remove a number.
3. Clear entire list.
4. Display the numbers.
5. Display statistics.
0. Exit

Option 1 will allow the user to add another number to the list. Option 2 will allow a user to enter a number to be removed from the list. Option 3 will remove all numbers from the list. Option 4 Will display the list of numbers, ordered from low to high. Option 5 will display the lowest number, highest number, sum of all numbers, the mean and the median. Your project will accept real numbers. Your program will run in a loop until 0 is selected to exit.

Make sure to create a class called Stats. Stats will be a container class that holds the values of all the real numbers. Stats will have the following public functions.
void sort()
double minimum()
double maximum ()
double sum()
double mean()
double median()

Do not make Stats a template class! We're keeping it simple for the first project. You are allowed to use functions in main.cpp to make your cold more logical. Make sure that your code is logical and readable.
